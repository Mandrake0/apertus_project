# Cylces Ligth 

## Idea
The core functin comes from the Blinkers Projekt where i have meet the core team whitch are very friendly.

so why copy there idea? 
it's a simple product and there Product is not Open Source so a simpler Open Source Product as a building set could help Apertus to generate a income.
there is also a functional differece where this product hasn't got a laser beam.

## Ressources 
For creating the Project the Ressources are small and most components can be used in other projects or are already used in the apertus.  

## Functionality

#### Back Light

* Blinking Left / Right
* Break Light
* Back Light
* Communication per Bluetooth
* Easy Mounting for Cycles
* Batterypack Functions

#### Front Light

The Function are overloaded so it can be used with a Microphone for Actor Recording.

* Front Light
* Microphe Connector
* SD Card Slot
* Small Display
* Communication per Bluetooth
* Easy Mounting for Cycles

## Design

There will be Two Core Elements the Front and the Back Lights with two Holders. 

The Design could be simple that it reduces the material and specialy the tooling cost.

## Hardware

The Hardware Components are mostly Bluetooth Module, Battery and LED Stripes.

Material cost would be low. mostly the tooling will cost a lot.
